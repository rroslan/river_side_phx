```

## Known Issues

- Not affecting production functionality
- Needs update to test fixtures

### 2. QR Code Tab üü°
- QR code option still visible on home page
- Non-functional but doesn't break anything
- Can be hidden if desired

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

2. **Fix Test Suite**: Update test fixtures to handle new email format
3. **Update Documentation**: Remove references to QR functionality

### Future Enhancements

2. **Print Table Cards**: Static `/table_numbers.html` available for printing
3. **Analytics**: Add table utilization tracking

## File Changes Summary

### Modified Files
- `router.ex` - Fixed guest access to menu page

### Stashed Changes

## Conclusion

The system is fully operational with the simple table selection approach. The customer flow works smoothly:
