# River Side Food Court - Cleanup Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the cleanup work performed on the River Side Food Court codebase, including the removal of unused files and resolution of compilation warnings.

## Files Removed

### 1. PageController and Related Files
The following files were removed as they were no longer in use. The application now uses `TableLive.Index` as the main entry point instead of `PageController`:

- **`lib/river_side_web/controllers/page_controller.ex`**
  - Previously handled the home page routing
  - Functionality replaced by LiveView components
  
- **`lib/river_side_web/controllers/page_html.ex`**
  - Module for PageController templates
  - No longer needed without PageController

- **`lib/river_side_web/controllers/page_html/home.html.heex`**
  - Phoenix framework default home page template
  - Displayed Phoenix logo and documentation links
  - Not relevant for the food court application

- **`lib/river_side_web/controllers/page_html/`** (directory)
  - Empty directory after removing home.html.heex
  - Removed to keep codebase clean

- **`test/river_side_web/controllers/page_controller_test.exs`**
  - Tests for the removed PageController
  - No longer applicable

## Compilation Warnings Fixed

### 1. Duplicate @doc Attributes
Fixed multiple compilation warnings about duplicate `@doc` attributes in:

- **`lib/river_side_web/live/admin_live/dashboard.ex`**
  - Removed duplicate @doc from multiple `handle_event/3` clauses
  - Kept the main @doc on the module and primary functions

- **`lib/river_side_web/controllers/user_session_controller.ex`**
  - Removed duplicate @doc from the second `create/2` clause
  - Kept documentation on the first clause

### 2. Private Function Documentation
Fixed warning about @doc on private function:

- **`lib/river_side_web/live/cashier_live/dashboard.ex`**
  - Removed @doc from private function `load_orders/1`
  - Documentation moved to code comments for maintainability

### 3. Corrupted Text
Cleaned up corrupted merge/edit markers in:

- **`lib/river_side_web/live/cashier_live/dashboard.ex`**
  - Removed `</end_text>` and `<old_text line=869>` markers
  - Fixed function structure and indentation

## Current Application Structure

After cleanup, the application entry points are:

1. **Main Route**: `/` â†’ `TableLive.Index`
   - Shows available tables in the food court
   - Allows customers to scan QR codes

2. **Authentication**: Magic link only
   - No password-based authentication
   - Email-based magic links with 20-minute expiry

3. **User Dashboards**: Role-based routing
   - Admin: `/admin/dashboard`
   - Vendor: `/vendor/dashboard`
   - Cashier: `/cashier/dashboard`
   - Customer: No login required, session-based

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Cleaner Codebase**
   - Removed 458 lines of unused code
   - Eliminated confusion from default Phoenix templates

2. **Warning-Free Compilation**
   - No more duplicate @doc warnings
   - Clean compilation output

3. **Focused Application**
   - Only food court-specific code remains
   - Clear separation of concerns

4. **Improved Maintainability**
   - Less code to maintain
   - Clearer application structure
   - Better documentation practices

## Next Steps

1. Update any remaining tests that expect password-based authentication
2. Consider adding integration tests for the table-based entry flow
3. Document the QR code workflow for new developers
4. Review and update deployment documentation if needed

## Git History

All changes have been committed with clear messages:
- Removed unused home page files
- Fixed documentation warnings
- Cleaned up corrupted text

The codebase is now cleaner, more focused, and easier to maintain.
