# Cart Navigation Fix

## Issue Description
When clicking the cart button from the menu page, users were being redirected back to the table selection page instead of viewing their cart.

## Root Cause
The cart route was in a different live session (`customer`) that required a customer role check via the `RequireRole` hook. When navigating from the menu (which was in the `customer_checkin` session), the customer session wasn't properly established, causing the authentication check to fail and redirect to the home page.

## Solution
Moved the cart route from the `customer` live session to the `customer_checkin` live session, allowing seamless navigation between menu and cart pages while maintaining customer context through URL parameters.

### Code Changes

#### Router Configuration (router.ex)
```elixir
# Before - cart was in a separate session requiring customer role
live_session :customer_checkin,
  on_mount: [{RiverSideWeb.UserAuth, :mount_guest_scope}] do
  live "/checkin/:table_number", CustomerLive.Checkin, :new
  live "/menu", CustomerLive.Menu, :index
end

live_session :customer,
  on_mount: [{RiverSideWeb.Hooks.RequireRole, :customer}] do
  live "/cart", CustomerLive.Cart, :index  # <-- This was the problem
  live "/orders", CustomerLive.OrderTracking, :index
end

# After - cart is now in the same session as menu
live_session :customer_checkin,
  on_mount: [{RiverSideWeb.UserAuth, :mount_guest_scope}] do
  live "/checkin/:table_number", CustomerLive.Checkin, :new
  live "/menu", CustomerLive.Menu, :index
  live "/cart", CustomerLive.Cart, :index  # <-- Moved here
end
```

## Customer Flow
The complete customer flow now works as follows:

1. **Table Selection** → Customer clicks on a table number
2. **Phone Entry** → Customer enters phone number at checkin page
3. **Menu Browsing** → Customer browses menu with URL params: `/customer/menu?phone=XXX&table=Y`
4. **Cart Access** → Customer clicks cart button which navigates to: `/customer/cart?phone=XXX&table=Y`
5. **Order Placement** → Customer reviews cart and places order

## Testing
Added comprehensive integration tests to verify the entire customer flow:
- Table selection and navigation
- Phone number entry
- Menu browsing and item selection
- Cart navigation with preserved customer info
- Cart quantity updates
- Empty cart handling
- Parameter validation

All 113 tests are passing, confirming the fix is working correctly.

## Benefits
- Seamless navigation between menu and cart
- Customer information preserved throughout the flow
- No authentication barriers for guests
- Simplified session management
- Better user experience

## Future Considerations
- Consider implementing proper session storage for customer info to avoid URL parameters
- Add browser session persistence for returning customers
- Implement proper guest session tokens for enhanced security
