# Test Suite Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes applied to the River Side Food Court test suite to accommodate the removal of password-based authentication in favor of magic link authentication.

## Changes Made

### 1. Accounts Test Fixes (`test/river_side/accounts_test.exs`)

#### Commented Out Password-Related Tests
- `describe "get_user_by_email_and_password/2"` - Entire test block commented out
- `describe "change_user_password/3"` - Entire test block commented out  
- `describe "update_user_password/2"` - Entire test block commented out
- `test "raises when unconfirmed user has password set"` - Individual test commented out

#### Modified Tests
- `test "registers users without password"` - Removed assertions for `hashed_password` and `password` fields that no longer exist in the schema

### 2. Login Test Fixes (`test/river_side_web/live/user_live/login_test.exs`)

#### Commented Out Password-Related Tests
- `describe "user login - password"` - Entire test block commented out, including:
  - `test "redirects if user logs in with valid credentials"`
  - `test "redirects to login page with a flash error if credentials are invalid"`

#### Modified Tests
- `test "shows login page with email filled in"` - Updated to expect redirect to settings page when already logged in
- Fixed unused variable warning by prefixing with underscore: `user` → `_user`

### 3. Magic Link Test Fixes (`test/river_side_web/magic_link_test.exs`)

#### Modified Implementation
- Changed from incorrect POST request to LiveView form submission
- Added proper token verification assertion
- Imported `Phoenix.LiveViewTest` for LiveView testing support

## Authentication Flow Changes

### Previous Flow (Password-based)
1. User enters email and password
2. System validates credentials against hashed password
3. Session created on successful validation

### Current Flow (Magic Link)
1. User enters email only
2. System sends magic link via email
3. User clicks link with token
4. System validates token and creates session
5. Previous sessions disconnected for security

## Test Suite Status

✅ **All 109 tests passing**
- No failures
- No warnings (after fixing unused variable)
- Consistent results across multiple test runs

## Security Considerations

The magic link implementation maintains security through:
- Time-limited tokens (20 minutes)
- One-time use tokens
- Generic error messages to prevent enumeration
- Automatic disconnection of previous sessions

## Next Steps

1. Monitor test suite stability over time
2. Add additional magic link edge case tests if needed
3. Consider adding integration tests for full authentication flow
4. Update any documentation referencing password-based auth

## Notes for Future Development

When adding new authentication-related features:
- Remember that password fields have been removed from the User schema
- All authentication goes through magic links
- Test helpers like `set_password()` and `valid_user_password()` no longer exist
- Use the magic link flow for any auth-related testing
