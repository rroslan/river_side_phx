# River Side Food Court - Project Status

## Project Overview
River Side Food Court is a web-based food ordering system built with Phoenix LiveView and Elixir. The application allows customers to order food from multiple vendors in a food court setting.

## Current Status: ✅ Fully Operational

### Core Features Implemented

#### 1. Customer Flow
- **Table Selection**: Simple dropdown selection of table numbers (1-50)
- **Phone Entry**: Customers enter phone number for order tracking
- **Menu Browsing**: Browse menus from multiple vendors
- **Cart Management**: Add/remove items, adjust quantities
- **Order Placement**: Submit orders with table and phone information
- **Order Tracking**: Real-time order status updates

#### 2. Authentication System
- **Magic Link Authentication**: Passwordless login via email
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin, Vendor, Cashier, and Guest roles
- **Session Management**: Secure token-based sessions
- **Remember Me**: Optional persistent login

#### 3. Admin Features
- **Dashboard**: Overview of system activity
- **User Management**: Create and manage users
- **Vendor Management**: Add/edit vendors and menus
- **Order Monitoring**: View all orders across vendors

#### 4. Vendor Features
- **Vendor Dashboard**: View own orders
- **Order Management**: Update order status
- **Menu Management**: Update menu items and prices

#### 5. Cashier Features
- **Payment Processing**: Mark orders as paid
- **Order Overview**: View orders requiring payment

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Framework**: Phoenix 1.8.0-rc.4 with LiveView
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Ecto
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI components
- **Real-time**: Phoenix PubSub for live updates

### Database Schema
- **Users**: Stores user accounts with roles
- **Tables**: Physical tables in the food court
- **Vendors**: Food vendors in the court
- **MenuItems**: Items offered by vendors
- **Orders**: Customer orders with status tracking
- **OrderItems**: Individual items within orders

### Authentication Flow
1. User requests magic link via email
2. System sends time-limited token (20 minutes)
3. User clicks link to authenticate
4. Session created, previous sessions disconnected

## Recent Changes

### Simplified Table Management
- Removed QR code implementation (deemed unnecessary for food court)
- Implemented simple table number selection
- Streamlined customer flow

### Test Suite Fixes
- Removed all password-related tests
- Updated authentication tests for magic link flow
- Fixed redirect expectations
- All 109 tests passing

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Elixir 1.18.3
- Erlang/OTP 28
- PostgreSQL
- Node.js (for assets)

### Getting Started
```bash
# Install dependencies
mix deps.get
mix assets.setup

mix ecto.setup

# Run tests
mix test

# Start server
mix phx.server
```

## Security Features
- CSRF protection
- SQL injection prevention via Ecto
- XSS protection
- Secure session management
- Time-limited authentication tokens
- One-time use tokens

## Performance Considerations
- Efficient database queries with preloading
- LiveView for reduced server load
- Optimized asset pipeline
- Connection pooling

## Known Issues
- None currently identified

## Future Enhancements (Potential)
1. **Analytics Dashboard**: Sales reports and metrics
2. **Mobile App**: Native mobile ordering experience
3. **Loyalty Program**: Customer rewards system
4. **Multi-language Support**: Internationalization
5. **Payment Integration**: Online payment processing
6. **Kitchen Display System**: Dedicated kitchen order screens
7. **Customer Notifications**: SMS/Push notifications for order updates

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow Elixir formatting standards (`mix format`)

- Add documentation for public functions
- Write tests for new features

### Git Workflow
- Feature branches for new development
- Descriptive commit messages
- Code review before merging

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for workflows
- LiveView tests for UI interactions
- Keep test coverage high

## Deployment Considerations

### Production Checklist
- [ ] Set production environment variables
- [ ] Configure database connection pooling
- [ ] Setup SSL certificates
- [ ] Configure email service for magic links
- [ ] Setup monitoring and logging
- [ ] Configure backup strategy
- [ ] Load test the application

### Environment Variables
